# net-keepalive
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/net-keepalive.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/net-keepalive/)

The Missing (`TCP_KEEPINTVL` and `TCP_KEEPCNT`) `SO_KEEPALIVE` socket option setters and getters for Node using [`ffi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi) module. Tested on `linux`, should work on `osx` and `freebsd`.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save net-keepalive
```


## Demo
```Javascript
var Net = require('net')
  , NetKeepAlive = require('net-keepalive')
;

// Create a TCP Server
var srv = Net.createServer(function(s){
  console.log('Connected %j', s.address())
  // Doesn't matter what it does
  s.pipe(s)
});

// Start on some port
srv.listen(1337, function(){
  console.log('Listening on %j', srv.address())
});

// Connect to that server
var s = Net.createConnection({port:1337}, function(){
  console.log('Connected to %j', s.address())
  
  //IMPORTANT: KeepAlive must be enabled for this to work
  s.setKeepAlive(true, 1000)

  // Set TCP_KEEPINTVL for this specific socket
  NetKeepAlive.setKeepAliveInterval(s, 1000)
  
  // Get TCP_KEEPINTVL for this specific socket
  NetKeepAlive.getKeepAliveInterval(s) // 1000

  // Set TCP_KEEPCNT for this specific socket 
  NetKeepAlive.setKeepAliveProbes(s, 1)
  
  // Get TCP_KEEPCNT for this specific socket 
  NetKeepAlive.getKeepAliveProbes(s) // 1
});
```

Now using `iptables` add rule to drop all `tcp` packets on `INPUT` chain to port `1337`.
```bash
$ iptables -I INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 1337 -j DROP
``` 
If you were monitoring packets on `loopback` with `tcp.srcport == 1337 || tcp.dstport == 1337` filter in `wireshark`.  You will see the following output:

Have fun!

`C` Code examples here: [Examples](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/programming.html#examples)

## API

***Note: For these methods to work you must enable `SO_KEEPALIVE` and set the `TCP_KEEPIDLE` options for socket using `Net.Socket`-s built in method [`socket.setKeepAlive([enable][, initialDelay])`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_setkeepalive_enable_initialdelay) !***

    TCP_KEEPIDLE (since Linux 2.4) The time (in seconds) the connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes, if the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE has been set on this socket. This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

```JavaScript
var NetSocket = require('net-keepalive')

// .....
// get socket somehow
// .....

var enable = true                                           // enable SO_KEEPALIVE
var initialDuration = 1000                                  // start probing after 1 second of inactivity
socket.setKeepAlive(enable, initialDuration)                // sets SO_KEEPALIVE and TCP_KEEPIDLE

var probeInterval = 1000                                    // after initialDuration send probes every 1 second
NetSocket.setKeepAliveInterval(socket, probeInterval)       //sets TCP_KEEPINTVL

var maxProbesBeforeFail = 10                                // after 10 failed probes connection will be dropped 
NetSocket.setKeepAliveProbes(socket, maxProbesBeforeFail)   // sets TCP_KEEPCNT

// ....
// ....
```

### setKeepAliveInterval(socket, msecs)
* `socket` - `instanceof Net.Socket`- Socket to modify
* `msecs` - `Number` - Time in milliseconds between KeepAlive probes.
* Returns `true` on success

Sets `TCP_KEEPINTVL` to `msecs` miliseconds (converted to seconds `int` internally) for the `socket` based on its file descriptor (`fd`)

    TCP_KEEPINTVL (since Linux 2.4) The time (in seconds) between individual keepalive probes. This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

### getKeepAliveInterval(socket)
* `socket` - `instanceof Net.Socket`- Socket to modify
* Returns `msecs` - `Number` - Time in milliseconds between KeepAlive probes on success

Gets `TCP_KEEPINTVL`. The `msecs` miliseconds (converted from seconds `int` internally) set for the `socket` based on its file descriptor (`fd`)

    TCP_KEEPINTVL (since Linux 2.4) The time (in seconds) between individual keepalive probes. This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.


### setKeepAliveProbes(socket, count) 
* `socket` - `instanceof Net.Socket`- Socket to modify
* `count` - `Number` - Number of probes to send before dropping the connection
* Returns `true` on success

Sets `TCP_KEEPCNT` to `count` number of probes for the `socket` based on its file descriptor (`fd`)

    TCP_KEEPCNT (since Linux 2.4) - The maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.


### getKeepAliveProbes(socket) 
* `socket` - `instanceof Net.Socket`- Socket to modify
* Returns `count` - `Number` - Number of probes to send before dropping the connection on success.

Gets `TCP_KEEPCNT`. The `count` number of probes set for the `socket` based on its file descriptor (`fd`)

    TCP_KEEPCNT (since Linux 2.4) - The maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.
